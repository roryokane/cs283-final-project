C forms that have a keyword, a parenthesized consition, and a block (statement represented by indented statements inside of curly braces)
for rule 3, which removes the parentheses in such forms

check all C keywords in list at http://tigcc.ticalc.org/doc/keywords.html, and whether they are in such a form

do … while
for
if
if … else
while
switch … case … default

the switch makes me think… a further development would be to make a switch-no-fall-through keyword that automatically adds “break;”


keywords that take a block not of statements, but of something else – relevant to rule 2:

enum
struct
