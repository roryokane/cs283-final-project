CS 283 Better C whitespace idea

do whitespace processing AFTER determining what is code and what is comments/strings. Then code can have normalized indentation (though still preserve spaces after indentation), but literal strings with mixed whitespace are preserved.

That means moving indent processing to after the parse tree step. It would substitute whitespace in text of nodes with indent/dedent notes where appropriate.



My technique should be able to handle a grammar representing a tree of symbols and literal backslash-escaped strings such as this:


animals
	dog
		thoughts
			"woof"
		color
			black
		attitude
			loyal
	cat
		attitude
			aloof
		color
			red
		thoughts
			"meow"
	human
		color
			pink
		thoughts
			"I wonder what I’ll have for breakfast tomorrow.

Also, how about that other thing?

You know, here is some of my favorite whitespace:
\" \", \"
\", and \"	\". And here they are mixed together: '  
  foo 
    	 bar
'.

My favorite animal is the porpoise."
		attitude
			curious


grammar for that:

text -> literal | escape_sequence
…



There are two possible ways to handle literal indentation. One is to collapse it to INDENT and DEDENT at first but save the literal text, and then allow the parser to request it transformed back into the original text in the places it wants. The other way is to use custom code that runs in the parsing, using Parslet’s `dynamic`, to track indentation and convert whitespace to INDENT/DEDENT as it encounters whitespace while parsing a statement_list.
